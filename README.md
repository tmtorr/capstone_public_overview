This project intends to create a personal health and safety device that can display the user’s location history via a multiplatform app, as well as send event-driven messages to a subscribing app.
The purpose of this project is to provide timely assistance in case of emergencies when every second counts. 
It can also help in tracking user's location at every x intervals for user's own use.
